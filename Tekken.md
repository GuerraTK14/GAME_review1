## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.
Tekken as created by Namco is a martial art fighting skill with a twist of unexpected moves not seen before. Having at least 20 different characters each with their own fighting skills and even different backstories behind each character. Some with an objective to win the tournament as wanting the money to gain more experience and or expand in their life. While others only want to enter the tournament to seek revenge that another opponent might have. The game uses a 60 second battle for each round, the objective is to at least win two rounds in order to proceed to the next battle. Characters can use their super moves by letting the gamers use the special combo moves that allow the characters do extra damage toward the other fighter. Within 12 battles finally the gamer will face off with one of two of the big bosses which increases the difficulty of the round and making the gamer use more special moves while still defending and moving in a quick manner. After all that has been completed the gamer will then see the characters ending for their journey or story ending the game for that character specifically. The more you play the more characters and prizes you can unlock.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph. The main reason why I like tekken 7 is because of the combat system and each fighter is different. One is fast with rapid kicks while the other could be slow but powerful punches but once you pick a character and practice for a long period then your capable of knowing longer button pressing combos. Also, it's crazy when youâ€™re facing someone and find out who is better at the game..
